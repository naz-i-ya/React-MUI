Typography: 
  -->To use MUI's Typography we first need to import at the top
  " import { Typography } from '@mui/material' "
  -->Then invoke into jsx by opening and closing tags like :<Typography></Typography>
  -->There are 13 different variations and i'm going to cover 10 in this 

  Headings variants: To spacify the variant we use the variant prop it ranges from "h1 to h6"
    like: <Typography variant='h1'>h1 Heading</Typography>
    There are 2 more variants of the h6 tag which doesn't stand out as much as h6 variant 
    there are : subtitle1 and subtitle2[<Typography variant='subtitle1'>subtitle1</Typography>]

  Body varaiants : To spacify the variant we use the variant prop body1(is a default variant of the prop) and body2
    like: <Typography variant='body1'>para</Typography>
    is as same as p tag.

   gutterBottom: bottom margin
